# Genome assembly used for GO analysis, format must be as below, with the genome assembly first, and the version of ensembl second, separated by a period (Unless there is only one ensembl version, then just write assembly).
assembly: mm10 # or hg38

# The column name of the characteristic you would like to do DE on. Example: Diagnosis, genotype, etc. This must be a column in your omic_meta_data.
linear_model:
  #Column name in meta data file to generate contrasts by
  Condition

# The column name in which your sampleIDs are defined in omic_meta_data. These should match the sampleIDs in your fastq files.
sample_id:
  #Column name listing unique sample ids to be used. This needs to be the first column in the meta data file
  SampleID

# The column names in your omic_meta_data file which you would like to annotate your heatmaps by. This is used as a QC to look for batch effects. Enter columns which could potentially introduce a batch effect in your data.
meta_columns_to_plot:
  Condition: Condition

pca:
  labels:
    #Column name in meta data file to generate group files and comparisons
    - Condition

# Define contrasts as target-vs-baseline, such as mutatn-vs-wildtype.
# This format is completely different from the original scheme written by JEstabrook.
# This format will have better compatibility with the maxsonBraunLab/atac_seq pipeline to facilitate easier data interpretation.
diffexp:
  # contrasts to generate group files and perform comparisons
  contrasts:

  # This option is specified if you would like to run DESeq2 on a subset of your samples (> pairwise comparison)

# If you would like to colour your QC plots by an RColorBrewer palette, list that palette under the rcolorbrewer parameter, otherwise, write "NA"
# If you would like to colour your QC plots by specific colours, please list them under the discrete category, with one colour for each bullet point
## The discrete colours will be assigned to your Conditions (ie. linear_model) in the order that they show up in your metadata table, when it is ordered alphabetically by sample ID
## There must be the same number of colours listed as there are Conditions
# If no options are specified, the default ggplot2 colours are used
